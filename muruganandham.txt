   The verdict of the five-judge Bench is anchored to two key findings. 
   However, it does not mean the Court has in any way diluted the part of the earlier Bench’s verdict reading into Indian law the full import of international rules in favour of animal rights.
  These sports also pose an undeniable hazard to humans too; to the participants mainly, but sometimes spectators too.
 It may be time for organisers to mandate protective gear for the participants and strictly enforce rules for proper barricades to keep spectators safe.
